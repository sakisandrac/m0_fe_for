# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
- this was definitely the section that I felt the least confident in. Even though I went through all the exercises and finished them I still dont feel like everything has sunk in, like I could wake up tomorrow and it will all be gone.

2. This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
- It was hard to combine the concepts that we've learned before with the for statements. I did get to a point where I unproductive struggled but I took a small break and came back and realized I was mising something so simple I overlooked it the first time because I was just tired of staring at the screen. 

3. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
- I need to practice pretty much everything. Sometimes I feel really clear headed and can do the problems but other times I feel like I stare at the screen and I dont even know where to start. I suspect that it is because the concepts just live in my short term memory and I have not internalized them yet. I think I need to add specific time blocks in my day, maybe even just for 30-45 mins to review concepts from the day before so that ecentually they can transfer into my long term memory. 

4. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
- I want to know what other things for statements are useful for, besdies iterating over arrays. How are they useful in code in the real world? I know I am jumping ahead but I like to connect smaller concepts with bigger picture so it gives me motivation to remember them and it helps me understand what I'm doing any way its important a bit more.
